# BIGINT-IMPLEMENTATION
To handle the challenge of storing a 22-digit number, which exceeds the capacity of any primitive data type like "long long int" in C/C++, a specialized data type named BigInt was created. This BigInt data type allows us to work with extremely large integers and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication..
